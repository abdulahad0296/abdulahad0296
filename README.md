ML Engineer (Early Career) | Automating Boring Tasks with Python
</h3>

---

I’m an early-career ML Engineer and MSc student in Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning, learning how to automate repetitive and time-consuming tasks using Python.

I come from a physics background, which has given me a strong base in mathematics, statistics, and analytical thinking. Right now, my focus is on understanding how data, machine learning models, and backend systems work together in real projects—not just in isolated notebooks.

I’m building small but practical systems step by step, with an interest in data pipelines, basic ML workflows, and simple AI-powered applications.
